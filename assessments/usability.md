# Executive Summary
This document is a reflective analysis of the methodology utilised to evaluate the usability of the system.\
The evaluation is done through having a participant perform actions in the system in a controlled setting,
as the product is autonomous much of these tasks are booting up and establishing the system and subsequent powering/shutting down of said system.\
The incorporation of user feedback and performance metrics helped identify areas of improvement and improved the prototype.
With the release of the end product on the horizon the collected and used data from usability testing has been invaluable to the constant improvement to the system.

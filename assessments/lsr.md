> #### About Self-Assessment Reports
> Self-assessment reports are submitted at the end of Semester 2, and must contain *explicit evidence* for all claims made.
> The self-assessment report will be used to determine the individual contributions for this Unit of Study.
> * Please contact your Project Supervisor prior to the submission date if you would like to get feedback on certain aspects of your report.
>
> #### About this Template Document
> This template has been provided to help those students who are unsure of what they need to provide in their short report or how to present it.
>
> You do NOT need to use this template.
> You are free to create your own document and format as you wish, as long as the report *contains the required information*.
> If you prefer using your own document format, please discuss the format you wish to use with your Project Supervisor.
>
> #### Suggested Order
> You may want to work on the sections in reverse order.
> That is:
> 1. Start by thinking about each of the three consolidated Learning Outcome areas (Product, Process/Procedure and Involvement) and
> list work that you have evidence for (and consider what grade level you are achieving).
> 2. Next, review (collect) each of the unique evidence items you have and list them once in the "List of Contributions" section.
> 3. Write the summary.
> 4. Lastly, reflect.
>
> DELETE THIS PAGE (TEXT BOX) AFTER YOU READ IT!
>
> REPLACE or DELETE ALL TEXT IN RED - THE TEXT IN RED ONLY SERVES AS A GUIDE FOR YOU TO COMPLETE THE REPORT!

## Introduction
> The purpose of this report is to clearly communicate my individual outcomes for the unit SWE40002 - Software Engineering Project B.
> This report has been structured to include self-assessment details to support my learning objectives,
> a summary list of specific major supporting evidence including an analysis of my activities,
> a detailed presentation of the alignment between the evidence details with the learning outcomes, and
> a personal reflection on the overall learning and outcomes.

<!-- State any other introduction details you want to mention here ... -->

## Self Assessment
> In this section answer/address the following points:
> * List the roles/responsibilities you have undertaken and briefly state the expectation (what you were expected to do) for each.
> * A *brief summary* of what you achieved during the duration of the project and their significance to the project and your learning.

## List of Contributions
> List here *your significant participation and contributions* to the project.
> Avoid being too general: aim for specific details.
>
> ```gherkin
> @Note:
> You will match items in this list to the specific learning outcome areas in the next section, so you do not need to do that here.
> ```
>
> #### TABLE(?)
> Strongly suggest you include table of items with columns for:
> * Each item/document/deliverable with a link/path to where it can be found,
> * The hours you spent on the item, overall % contribution (if this can be determined) and/or any measure of quality.
>
> #### CHART(S)?
> Try to include visual representations to support your claims/contributions.
>
> For example, worklog hour charts (perhaps listed by type), repository activity (your contributions, distribution over time),
> measures of your contribution within the team (proportional charts), progress measures (burn-down or milestone charts),
> measures of testing (defect counts or fixes over time), review (quality process) activities, and so on!
>
> Pro-tip: only include *useful* figures!

<div class="page"/><!-- page break -->

## Learning Outcome Assessment
> In this section, you consider each key learning outcome area, list your actual evidence so far.
> This is a "coverage" activity.
>
> ```gherkin
> @Note:
> Only list what you have actually completed!
> ```
>
> Select the best two or three examples and expand them with specific details.
>
> For example, if one of your best "Process" contributions was to improve the meeting process, you could state this,
> then link to documents in the repository, such as meeting agenda (where you put forward your suggestion),
> meeting minutes (discussion, decisions, actions - which agreed to do), tasks completed as a result (show in changes to the SQAP).

### Product
In the product area, the following are general criteria expected for each grade level.

#### Pass
*"Contributed adequately to the product.*\
*Overall, the team must have produced at least a semi-functional product that meets part of the client requirements".*

#### Credit
*"Contributed strongly and consistently to the product over the duration of the project.*\
*Overall, the team must have produced a solid functional product that meets significant client requirements, using good design standards and practices".*

#### Distinction
*"Contributed significantly, consistently and of a high standard, to the product over the duration of the project".*

<!--

<!--
You may use the sample table format below.

|Contribution|Description|Estimated % of the total product|Which client requirements does each address?|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Code||||
|Other Assets||||
-->

> In order to demonstrate that *you have contributed code to a final deliverable* (or multiple deliverables),
> evidence must show contribution of a reasonable portion of code towards each of the listed deliverables.

<!--
To show a credit level outcome, you might want to consider the following type of table to capture the "strong and consistent" contribution.

|Contribution|Which software design does each address?|Estimated % completion against the design|Period of activity|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Code||||
|Other Assets||||
-->

<!--
For Distinction or High Distinction you'll want to clearly show your contribution is "significant", of a "high standard", and
that it occurred over the duration of the entire project.

|Contribution beyond what's assigned|What phases of the SDLC were you involved in?|Describe the effect of the software if the component's replaced with a stub?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Code|||
|Other Assets|||
-->

### Process
In the process area, the following are general criteria expected for each grade level.

#### Pass
*"Demonstrated ability to follow (mostly) the process documented by the team".*

#### Credit
*"Demonstrated ability to accurately follow the process documented by the team".*

#### Distinction
*"Demonstrated contribution to the definition and ongoing improvement of good process used by the team".*

> Evidence must show completion of most of assigned tasks (say 80% or more), supported with evidence such as meeting minutes, task tracking and/or repository logs.

<!--
If you are trying to show Credit level outcomes (accurately following process), you might want to use this type of table.

|Demonstration|deadline as set in meeting|Date started|Date Completed|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|:-|:-|:-|
|Section No.|||
-->

> For distinction, you might look for at least two contributions that address problems affecting at least half the members of your team.

### Involvement
In the involvement area, the following are general criteria expected for each grade level.

#### Pass
*"Acceptable level of attendance and engagement with respect to both internal (team) and external (client) related activities".*

#### Credit
*"An active level of engagement (internal and external), including organisation and leadership responsibilities".*

#### Distinction
*"An active level of contribution across multiple areas or responsibilities of the project, including significant input to important decisions (documented)".*

#### High Distinction
*"Active leadership/ownership of key responsibilities resulting in high quality outcomes for the project.*\
*Key indicators of this would include personal contribution across multiple areas of the project, as well as providing support and leadership to members of the team".*

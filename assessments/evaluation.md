# Executive Summary
The document specifies the methodology by which usability is evaluated and explains how the results are interpreted.
The evaluation process involves the usage of a prototype and a participant in a controlled environment that closely emulates practical setting.
The evaluation methodology encompasses both quantitative and qualitative measures,
incorporating user feedback and performance metrics to identify areas of improvement from the prototype.
The collected data is analysed and serves as guide to further develop the prototype into a complete and satisfactory end-product.

# Methodology
The factors mentioned below must be achieved to ensure a successful usability test.

#### Number of participants
A healthy number of participants would be needed to collect sufficient data to create the best possible interface.
A minimum of 4 participants would be needed for this experiment.

#### Environment
The experiment will be conducted in the Swinburne usability testing lab in the SA building.
The lab has a test room where the participant will undertake the test and the control room where the observers will be watching and logging the test.

#### Tools
"Morae Recorder" and "Morae Observer" would be used to observe and record participant feedback while tracking the time taken to complete each task.

#### Measures
Completion rate, error rate and subjective evaluations would be used as metrics to measure user performance to evaluate the application.

#### Demographic Information
A demographic questionnaire would be handed over to the participant right before the test,
to ensure that the participant belongs to the target user group that would use the product.

#### Satisfaction Assessment
After the experiment, the participant would be handed a satisfaction questionnaire where they would inform us about what problems they found with the interface and
the suggestions they must fix these problems.

# Participants
The end user of the Vuzix Smart Glass would be an employee or trainee working with an instructor in a training program.
Apart from basic experience with technology, the participant would not be expected to have any additional technology skills.

Participants have the responsibility to complete tasks given to them while giving feedback by talking about their thought process while doing the task.
Participants are also asked to complete a demographic questionnaire pre-evaluation, and satisfaction questionnaire post evaluation.
The experiment would be a simulation of a real-life training scenario, therefore the participants would be students imitating the role of the operator and instructor.
Participant recruitment would be done through social media.

# Training
The participant will be given a brief overview of how the Vuzix Smart Glass works,
where the buttons are located and hand gestures to trigger functions as the participant might not have any prior experience using the product.

# Procedure
Participants will undertake the usability evaluation test at the Swinburne Usability Laboratory located in the AS building.
The lab has a test room and a control room separated by a two-way mirror.
The test room is equipped with a computer, webcam and a microphone connected to another computer in the control room.
A software called Morae Observer and Morae Recorder would be used to record user feedback from the control room.

Before the experiment,
the participant is briefed on how the experiment will be conducted with a short training session to introduce the hand gestures needed to trigger certain functions.
Informed consent would inform the participant that they can leave at any time, how they will be recorded while keeping their identity protected.

The participant will fill out a demographic questionnaire before the test,
a post-task questionnaire after completing each task and a post-test satisfaction questionnaire.
To get a verbal record which could be reviewed, the participant would be asked to read the task aloud and think aloud while doing the task.

# Roles
Members of the team will be assigned roles that they must carry out during the experiment.

#### Trainer
Gives the participant a brief training session before the test.

#### Facilitator
Briefs the participant on how the test will be conducted and will be available to respond to the participant's requests.

#### Test Observer
Logs down participant feedback, while analysing application issues.

# Usability Tasks
The tasks are common tasks which every end user would expect to do while using the application.
The tasks aren't same for each participant with some playing the role of the operator,
while others play the role of the instructor, and would be given different tasks accordingly.

The tasks include sketching,
taking screenshots and sending video feed which are significant as it will be the most basic tasks which will be done every time the smart glasses are used.
All of the tasks in the tests would be significant which end users of the application must not find any issues with.
The task descriptions will be reviewed by the project supervisor, and client.
Their acceptance would be documented.

# Usability Metrics
Usability requirements can be evaluated using usability metrics like scenario completion rates, error rates, subject evaluations and
time of completion will be used to calculate usability performance on tasks.

## Scenario Completion
A scenario is completed when the user has gotten the expected output or when the user requests assistance and cannot complete the task due to usability issues.

## Errors
There are two types of errors being critical and non-critical errors.
Critical errors are those of which prevent the user from getting the expected output and
non-critical errors are errors which the user can recover from but could potentially give an unexpected outcome.

## Subjective Evaluations
Post-test satisfaction questionnaires are a method of collecting subjective evaluations at the end of the session.

## Time on Task
Time taken to complete each scenario is recorded.

# Usability Goals
The usability goals for this usability evaluation would be a completion rate of 100% and an error-free rate of 80%.
The completion rate is the percentage of participants who successfully complete the task without critical errors.
The error-free rate is the percentage of participants who complete the task without both critical and non-critical errors.

# Problem Severity
Problems that are seen during the testing must be classified under severity which is dependent on impact and frequency.

## Impact ranking
#### High
A critical error which prevents the user from completing the task.

#### Moderate
A non-critical error which causes the user to have a larger time on task despite the task being completed.

#### Low
A user encounters a minor non-critical error.

## Frequency ranking
#### High
Greater than 30% of the participants encountered the issue

#### Moderate
13%-29% of the participants encountered the issue

#### Low
Less than 13% of the participants encountered the issue

## Severity Ranking
#### Severity 1
An issue with high severity and high impact preventing the user from completing the task.
This kind of issue must be fixed as quickly as possible.

#### Severity 2
An issue with moderate to high frequency with moderate impact which doesn't allow the user to complete the task efficiently.

#### Severity 3
An issue with either moderate frequency with low impact or low frequency with moderate impact that might frustrate some users.

#### Severity 4
An issue with low frequency and low impact that might increase user satisfaction if the problem is to be resolved.

# Reporting Results
The usability evaluation test will be concluded with a usability test report presenting the results with the usability metrics compared with the usability goals and
recommendations resolve the problems.

## Unit Summary
**Note that the lectures are to be conducted live online via Canvas/Collaborate-Ultra.**

**In general, project meetings in project teams (with or without the project supervisor, or with the client) may be conducted on campus (e.g., in the library),**
**on client site or online, with agreement from all involved.**

### Aims
Students will consolidate and build on skills and knowledge gained in previous related studies and team work and

The "Project Work" and "Team Meeting" activities may require more time during some weeks of the semester and less in others.\
Students are advised to plan the work in this Unit of Study in the context of other time commitments.

### Week by Week Schedule
The following schedule is provisional and
further lecture topics will be added during the semester based on project needs and availability of guest lecturers, respectively.

### Assessment
#### Assessment Overview
Further details will be provided to the students during the semester.

#### Minimum requirements to pass this Unit
As this is a unit that requires group participation, students must attend all sessions and group meetings in order to achieve a pass in this unit of study.\
Students must participate in all assessment deliverables and formative assessment requirements in order to achieve a pass in this unit of study.\
Students must achieve **an overall grade of 50%** in order to pass this Unit of Study.

#### Examinations
There is no formal examination in this Unit of Study.

#### Submission Requirements
Assignments and other assessments are generally submitted online through the Canvas assessment submission system,
which integrates with the Turn-it-in plagiarism checking service.

Please ensure you keep a copy of all assessments that are submitted.

In cases where a hard copy submission is required an Assessment Cover Sheet must be submitted with your assignment.\
The standard Assessment Cover Sheet is available from the Current Students web site.

#### Extensions and Late Submission
Extensions to assessable items will only be granted in exceptional circumstances on medical or compassionate grounds.\
Extensions must be applied for in advance of the assessable item's due date and the convener of this Unit of Study must approve the extension in writing.

Where submissions are group submissions no extensions will be granted.

Late Submissions: unless an extension has been explicitly granted by the Unit of Study convener, you cannot submit an assessable item after the due date.\
If this does occur, you will be penalised 10% of the assessments worth for each calendar day the task is late - up to a maximum of 5 days.\
After 5 days a zero result will be recorded.\
Feedback or comments from the marker will generally not be available on assignments that are submitted after five working days past the published deadline.

#### Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you are required to provide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work.

Referencing conventions for assessable documents are to be negotiated with the project supervisor in advance.

Helpful information on referencing can be found at:\
<http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/>

#### Group Work Guidelines
A group assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire group, and
if one member is temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate responsibilities to keep to schedule.\
In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems involving a member of group,
it is the responsibility of the other members to immediately notify the Unit of Study Convenor and relevant project supervisor.

Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all members of the group.

All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted.\
Any penalties for late submission will generally apply to all group members, not just the person responsible for submission.
